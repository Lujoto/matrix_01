git merge combines the history of two branches. 

fast forward merge is used if only one branch has been made and updated
from main.

        -*-*
* - * -/
    ^      ^
main|      |branch


the fast forward merge takes the main pointer and shifts it to the branch position.

deleting the branch after merging is okay. The repo is left with one main branch. 

===

when pushing to remote repo, we bring the remote repo up to speed on the local changes
by moving the origin/main pointer to the latest in the branch. 

origin/main
    | 
* - * - * - *
            |
        local main

( NOTE:   can't push from Ubuntu application: prompts for username and password, 
        but then complains about no support for authentication. )
